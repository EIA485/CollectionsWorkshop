# Particle Workshop

A simple plugin for creating particles with color and alpha over time in [Neos VR Metaverse Engine](https://neosvr.com/).
Created by Gareth48 with some huge help from Epsilion!

## Getting Started (For Users)
1. Click this link to go to [releases](https://github.com/New-Project-Final-Final-WIP/ParticleWorkshop/releases)
1. Download the .dll
1. Navigate to your Libraries directory, usually ~\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\Libraries
1. Place the dll in that folder
1. In steam, right click Neos VR and select Properties
1. In launch settings paste this line -LoadAssembly "Libraries\ParticleWorkshop.dll"
1. Once you're in game you can check if it worked by checking your friends list, if your friends appear pink you've succeeded

## What to do once you're in game
1. Open the component browser and navigate to the tab labaled "Gareth"
1. There are two new components
1. Particle Master, which allows you to create a tailored particle based on custom inputs
1. Random Particles, which randomly generates a set amount of particles
1. Once you've created a particle, save it to your inventory, remove the launch option addition and reboot Neos
1. Enjoy your new particle! Feel free to use it as you please, if you do something neat with it I would love to see a picture!

## Known issues
1. You cannot add duplicate color or alpha transitions
1. You can only add up to 8 unique color transitions AND 8 unique alpha transitions
1. The gradient display will not update unless your sliders are linearly ordered by time
